# Fixed API Key Issue!

## The Problem
The API key in your `.env` file was corrupted with extra text ("vigor" in the middle).

## The Fix
I've created a new `.env` file with the correct API key format.

## Restart the Server

### Step 1: Stop the current server
In the terminal where `uvicorn` is running, press:
```
CTRL + C
```

### Step 2: Start the server again
```powershell
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Step 3: Test again in Postman
Upload your document again and you should now get proper responses with:
- Summary
- Key points
- Deadlines

## What Changed
The corrupted key had "vigor" in the middle:
```
...T3Bl vigorFJcgKjs...
```

Now it's fixed:
```
...T3BlbkFJcgKjs...
```

## Test It Now!
Try uploading a document in Postman and you should see a response like:

```json
{
  "filename": "Invoice_Sample.pdf",
  "document_type": "Invoice",
  "summary": "Invoice for products/services...",
  "key_points": [
    "Invoice Number: INV-123",
    "Date: January 1, 2024",
    ...
  ],
  "deadlines": [
    {
      "description": "Payment due",
      "date": "2024-02-01"
    }
  ]
}
```
